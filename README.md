Endless Horizontal Scroller Demo
================================

Simple demo on how one would implement a horizontal scroller using some sort of JavaScript animation library ([Velocity.js][0]).

A colleague of mine was tasked to implement a horizontal scroller. He asked me how I would implement it; at the time I was busy and could not help him. This is my quick implemention afterwards.
